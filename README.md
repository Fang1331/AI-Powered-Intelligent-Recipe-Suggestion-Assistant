# 🍽️ AI-Powered Intelligent Recipe Suggestion Assistant

This is a full-stack AI-powered application that generates structured, human-like cooking recipes using either:

- 🌟 **Google Gemini Pro Vision** (multimodal: text + image)
- 🧠 **Hugging Face FLAN-T5** (text-only)

You can input ingredients, select preferences like cuisine or complexity, or even upload an image of ingredients (for Gemini), and receive a complete recipe including a title, ingredients list, and step-by-step instructions.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- 📄 **Text Input**: Type ingredients and preferences → AI generates recipe.
- 📷 **Image Input** *(Gemini only)*: Upload a picture of ingredients or a dish → Gemini analyzes it and generates a recipe.
- 🧠 **Model Options**:
  - **Gemini Pro Vision**: Accepts image + text, generates more detailed outputs.
  - **Hugging Face FLAN-T5**: Fast and lightweight, text-only input.

## 🔧 How to Set Up Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fang1331/AI-Powered-Intelligent-Recipe-Suggestion-Assistant.git
cd AI-Powered-Intelligent-Recipe-Suggestion-Assistant
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup (Flask)

```bash
cd server
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Get Your Gemini API Key

1. Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey  
2. Generate an API key
3. Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` folder and add:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

✅ This file is listed in `.gitignore` so it won’t be committed to GitHub.

### 4. Run the Backend

```bash
python server.py
```

This starts your Flask API at `http://localhost:5000`.
